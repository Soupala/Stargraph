# Stargraph (early Alpha)
----------------

## What
Stargraph is a real-time, collaborative graph editor written in Meteor with the CytoscapeJS library.

## Demo
We will put up shortly on [Stargraph.xyz](http://stargraph.xyz)

## Installation
```
1. Install Meteor from https://www.meteor.com/install
2. Get the 'semi-stable' branch.  'master' has a couple bugs that prevent the graph from rendering.
3. $ cd stargraph
4. $ meteor
```
## Description and Goals
1. Stargraph Alpha was developed during a 24-hour period for the 2015 Meteor Global Distributed Hackathon by Joshua Chavez (@program3r), Mica Cardillo (@Soupala), and Max Franz (@maxkfranz).
2. In the context of Stargraph app, a graph (aka "network") consists of nodes (aka "vertices") and edges. Edges represent connections or relationships between nodes. Some common examples of nodes in a network include neurons, proteins, messages, planets, computers, routers, employees, work of arts, transportation vessels, computers, electrical substations, weather stations, and so forth.
3. The initial focus of Stargraph is to fine tune techniques for rendering large datasets in collaborative, real-time network editors.
4. Another goal is to continue developing and improving tools for sharing, collaboration, and organization of data, and make it easier for non-programmers explore data.
